Description: Development files to build programs using libhugetlbfs
 libhugetlbfs is a library which provides easy access to huge pages of
 memory. It is a wrapper for the hugetlbfs file system. Applications
 can use huge pages to fulfill malloc() requests without being
 recompiled by using LD_PRELOAD. Alternatively, applications can be
 linked against libhugetlbfs without source modifications to load text
 or BSS or BSS, data, and text segments into large pages. The library
 also comes with several userspace tools to help with huge page
 usability, environment setup, and control.
 .
 This package ships the library development files.
