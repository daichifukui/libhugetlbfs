The libhugetlbfs project uses a number of code submission rules from the
Linux kernel.  For instance, we follow the coding style document very
closely.  Please see:

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/CodingStyle?id=HEAD

For a very indepth look at coding style.

Also like the Linux kernel, we transact in patches over a mailing list.
The libhugetlbfs mailing is at:

libhugetlbfs@googlegroups.com

You do not need to be subscribed to send mail to that list.

I know that Github provides a nifty pull request tool, please do not use
it.  At best your request will be closed with reference to this document
or the mailing list, and at worst it will simply be ignored.

Libhugetlbfs does not require Copyright assignment to any particular
organization.  You (or the organization paying your wages) keep the
copyright for code you write.  We do require a Signed-off-by: line at
the end of the changelog.  For more on the how and why of this please
see:

http://git.kernel.org/cgit/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches?id=HEAD

And finally, if you have any questions send them to the list.  It is low
traffic and it might take you some time to get a response, but messages
sent there will be read eventually.
